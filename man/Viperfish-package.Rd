\title{
SEDs with Shark or Stingray
}
\description{
Makes SEDs with outputs from Shark and/or Stingray using ProSpect. Named "Viperfish"" due to its ability to make dark things (SAMs and dark-cones in this case) shine, a bit like the bioluminescent viperfish.

The basic flow is usually that SURFS makes an N-body sweet, this is processed by Velocitraptor and TreeFrog to make trees, Shark uses this to make a SAM output, Stingray turns this into a light-cone (but really a dark-cone at this stage), and Viperfish turns this into a true light-cone with SEDs attached to all of the galaxies and photometric outputs.
