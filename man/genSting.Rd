\arguments{
  \item{file_sting}{
Character scalar; full path to Stingray HDF5 file. The package will check that the file exists and we have read access.
}
  \item{mockcone}{
data.table; the output of \code{mockcone}.
}
  \item{path_shark}{
Character scalar; path to top directory containing Shark outputs. The package will check that the files and path exists and we have read access. This option and \option{config_file} are mutually exclusive. If none is given, '.' is assumed.
}
  \item{config_file}{
Character scalar; path to a shark configuration file, out of which the value of \option{path_shark} can be read. The package will check that the file exists and we have read access. This option and \option{path_shark} are mutually exclusive.
}
\item{id_galaxy_sam}{
Integer vector; a list of Shark SAM galaxies to be extracted from a given snapshot and subsnapshot.
}
  \item{h}{
Numeric scalar; little-h assumed in Shark (needed to convert SFRs to actual SFR since they use Msun/yr/h).
}
  \item{cores}{
Integer scalar; number of cores to process on.
}
  \item{snapmax}{
Integer scalar; maximum snapshot output by Shark.
}
  \item{filters}{
Character vector; filters to use for the photometry.
}
  \item{tau_birth}{
Numeric scalar; dust tau for birth clouds. Associated with sub 10 Myr star formation. See \code{\link{SFH}}.
}
  \item{tau_screen}{
Numeric scalar; dust tau for screen. See \code{\link{SFH}}.
}
  \item{time}{
Numeric vector; if provided this should be the full vector of lookback time corresponding to the time outputs in \option{SFHlist}. It should have the same length as the matrices in \option{SFHlist} have columns.
}
  \item{galsname}{
Character scalar; the name of the group containing galaxies in the Stingray HDF5 output (to cope with name changes through versions).
}
  \item{sparse}{
Numeric scalar; amount of sparse sampling of the spectra to make. Higher values mean coarser spectra is processed, which means less accurate photometry, but faster processing. Generally done when computing higher resolution libraries for AB mags.
}
  \item{intSFR}{
Boolean scalar; should the \option{massfunc} be intergrated between ages? This might be necessary if the SFH is quite bursty, but it is more expensive to compute and not required if the SFH is quite smooth.
}
  \item{snapshot}{
Integer scalar; snapshot number to use.
}
  \item{subvolume}{
Integer scalar; sub-volume snapshot number to use.
}
  \item{reorder}{
Logical; Should the output mock cone be re-ordered so to enforce that it is first ascending in subsnapID, followed by id_galaxy_sam within groups of subsnapID? It is safest to enforece this since the cones made by Stingray might not always be so ordered.
}
  \item{file_output}{
Character scalar; name for the temporary file to write to. This should not be an existing file.
}
  \item{verbose}{
Logical; should helpful verbose outputs be printed regarding the processing?
}
}
\details{
This interface is pretty high level, so should work fine if the paths are correct.
}
\value{
\code{genSting} returns a list called \option{outSED} containing a data.frame of named absolute and apparent magnitudes for bulge, disk and total photometry.

\code{getSFHfull} returns a full list of the SFRs and the Z for the bulge and disk (which can be passed to \code{genSting} directly) for a given Stingray mock cone.

\code{getSFHsing} returns a list of the SFRs and the Z for the bulge (disk instability and merger driven) and disk for a subset of galaxies for a given snapshot and subsnapshot. Also returns the id_galaxy_sam actually present, and the location of the present galaxies relative to the input \option{id_galaxy_sam} (keep).

\code{mockcone} outputs the contents of a target Stingray HDF5 into an R data.table. Mostly present for use inside \code{genSting}.

\code{mocksubsets} outputs the minimally required sub-volumes and SAM galaxy ID list from a target mockcone. Mostly present for use inside \code{genSting}.
